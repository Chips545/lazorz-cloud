Considerations
==============

 - Must be touch compatible (press/hold/release, not onHover)

 - 10x10 grid sise

Concepts
========
 - tap grid square to select it, tap item from toolbox to place on selected square. 
 - mobile: touch grid square, brings up tool box next to it, let go on the item you want. 

 - toolbox has remove tool - tap space, hit remove

 - can select multiple squares at any time, when tool is selected from box, its applied to all those squares. 

 - reset button for entire board. 

 - undo button for last move. 

 - individual clicks rotate items. clockwise to start. 

 - 45 degree angles (keep it simple) 


Tiles
=====

 - Mirrors
 - Filters
 - Blocks
 - Beams

Future?
=======
 - Prisms
 - Refractor
 - Crasy beam splitting things
 - concave vs convex mirrors
 - disco ball
 - multiple lazorz
 - beam combinorz
 - trap/black hole/obstacles
 - tons of ridiculous things (really anything)
 - moving items
 - timed events
 - fuses
 - short cut bonus
 - alt routes
